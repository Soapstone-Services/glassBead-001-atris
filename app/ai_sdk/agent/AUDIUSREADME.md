# Audius Agent Implementation

## Work Completed

1. Created a basic structure for the Audius agent in `audiusAgent.ts`.
2. Implemented a query router in `queryRouter.ts` to determine if a query is Audius-specific or general.
3. Updated the main `page.tsx` component to use both the Audius agent and the general agent based on the query type.
4. Defined an `AudiusAPITool` class as a LangChain tool for interacting with the Audius API.

## Remaining Tasks

1. Implement the actual API call logic in the `AudiusAPITool`:
   - Replace the placeholder response in the `_call` method with real Audius API interactions.
   - Handle authentication and API key management securely.

2. Enhance the Audius agent implementation:
   - Refine the prompt template to better guide the agent in using the Audius API tool.
   - Consider adding more Audius-specific tools if needed (e.g., for different types of Audius queries).

3. Improve error handling and edge cases:
   - Add more robust error handling in the `runAudiusAgent` function.
   - Consider how to handle cases where the query router might be uncertain.

4. Testing and validation:
   - Write unit tests for the `AudiusAPITool`, `queryRouter`, and `runAudiusAgent` functions.
   - Perform integration testing to ensure smooth interaction between components.

5. Documentation:
   - Add inline comments to explain complex parts of the code.
   - Create user documentation explaining how to use the Audius-specific features.

6. Performance optimization:
   - Profile the application to identify any performance bottlenecks.
   - Optimize API calls and agent execution if necessary.

7. UI/UX improvements:
   - Consider adding Audius-specific UI elements or indicators when the Audius agent is being used.
   - Implement better loading states and error messages for Audius-related queries.

8. Security review:
   - Ensure that API keys and secrets are properly managed and not exposed.
   - Review the application for any potential security vulnerabilities.

By completing these remaining tasks, we'll have a fully functional and robust system that can handle both Audius-specific queries and general questions, providing a seamless experience for users interacting with the Audius platform through our chatbot interface.
