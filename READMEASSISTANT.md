# AI Assistant Context for Audius API Integration Project

## Project Overview
This project integrates the Audius API into a LangChain-based application, creating an SDK for seamless interaction with Audius services. We are now shifting our focus towards using agents for more complex, multi-step interactions with the Audius platform.

## Current Focus
- Implementing LangChain agents for Audius API interactions
- Enhancing the complexity of queries our system can handle
- Improving the overall user experience with streaming responses

## Key Components
1. AudiusAgent (audiusAgent.ts)
2. LangGraph.js implementation for agentic workflows
3. Vercel AI SDK for token streaming
4. Next.js frontend for user interactions
5. Supabase for vector storage (for retrieval-based queries)

## Recent Developments
- Shifted from direct tool usage to agent-based interactions
- Implemented streaming responses using Vercel's AI SDK
- Set up LangGraph.js for creating custom agent workflows

## Next Steps
1. Implement and test basic agent functionalities
2. Develop more complex, multi-step query handling
3. Integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with agents
4. Optimize agent performance and response quality
5. Enhance the frontend to support more interactive agent-based conversations

## Agent Functionality Implementation Plan

### Priority Order:
1. Simple queries using agents (e.g., track information, artist details)
2. Multi-step queries (e.g., comparing tracks, finding related artists)
3. Complex queries with RAG (e.g., answering questions about Audius content)

### Key Features to Implement:
1. Agent-based trending content queries
2. User authentication integration with agents
3. Recommendation engine using agent decision-making
4. Social feature queries through agents
5. Comparative analysis of tracks, artists, and playlists using agents

### Implementation Strategy:
- Utilize LangGraph.js to create custom agent workflows
- Implement streaming responses for a better user experience
- Integrate Supabase as a vector store for RAG capabilities
- Develop a flexible agent system that can be easily extended for new query types

## Notes for Development
- Familiarize with LangGraph.js and its integration with LangChain
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms for agents
- Regularly test agent performance with various query complexities
- Consider implementing a hybrid approach, using both tools and agents where appropriate

## Version Information
- Langchain version: (Update to latest)
- @langchain/openai version: (Update to latest)
- @langchain/core version: (Update to latest)
- Node.js version: >=18

## Changelog

[Previous Date]: (Keep previous changelog entries)

## Summary of Agent Implementation Process

(Add a summary here, similar to the previous chatbot implementation summary, but focusing on the agent-based approach. Include challenges, strategies, and lessons learned during the transition to agents.)

## Accessibility Considerations

(Keep the existing accessibility section, as it's still relevant)

## Future Improvements

(Update this section to include agent-specific improvements and considerations)

1. Implement more sophisticated agent workflows for complex Audius-related tasks
2. Explore multi-agent systems for collaborative problem-solving
3. Integrate agent memory for improved context retention across conversations
4. Develop agent performance metrics and monitoring systems
5. Create a visual interface for tracking agent decision-making processes
6. Implement A/B testing for different agent configurations

By focusing on these agent-based improvements, we aim to create a more intelligent and flexible system for interacting with the Audius platform, capable of handling a wide range of user queries and tasks.
